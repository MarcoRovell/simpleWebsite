                    Will Smith showcases exceptional puck-handling abilities, employing deceptive moves and fakes to outmaneuver 
                    opponents effectively. Transitioning from a point-per-game U17 season to over two points per game in U18, he's 
                    now on track to surpass the 50-point milestone in his freshman college year. Beyond his natural skill, Smith 
                    impresses with his cerebral play style and adeptness at slot passing, often drawing attention and creating 
                    opportunities for his teammates. His versatility allows him to excel in various aspects of the game, including
                     passing, shooting, and deking, making him a formidable presence on the ice. While he still has areas for 
                     improvement, particularly in physical engagement and defensive play, his development trajectory suggests 
                     he'll become a key player in the NHL, likely filling a top-six center role and contributing significantly 
                     on the power play.</p>
