HTML
1. I learned how to start an ordered list at a number other than 1
2. I learned how to make a link open in a new tab rather than the current one using target="_blank"
3. I learned how to use <br> to fit text within its border effectively

CSS
1. I learned how to overshadow text using text-shadow, which gives text its own border if used correctly
2. I learned how to use the overflow property to allow divs that are side by side to both increase their borders together
3. I learned how to use :nth-child(), and other properties that use : to specify much more interesting and expansive ideas
